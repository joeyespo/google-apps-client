Google Apps Client
==================

Combines the ease and familiarity of Outlook's notifications with
the power of Google Apps.


Description
-----------

If you have a separate work computer, but prefer to link your browser with your
existing Google account, this is for you.

Google Apps Client helps you keep your personal and work identities separate. Use
the tray icon to access your work email and calendar. This allows you to keep
your existing account as the primary account in your browser, which reduces
mental overhead, and leads to higher productivity. Win!


How it works
------------

Google Apps Client runs in the background and alerts you when you have mail or an
upcoming appointment. Enter your work domain to open a new browser window when you
click on the tray icon. Enter your credentials to have the application check your
mail and calendar for alerts and notifications.
